# Simon Game

This is a simple mimic of the Simon Game - a game to test players on their short-term memory skills. The goal of the game is to remember the pattern as far as they can and advance to the highest level possible.

## Rules

Note: This game does not work on the mobile.

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
2. A colour (i.e. red) will flash, along with a corresponding sound played.
3. Click on that colour (i.e. red) to repeat the sequence.
4. The game will flash another colour (i.e. blue) to the sequence.
5. Repeat by clicking the colours in the correct order (i.e. red, then blue).
6. The game will continue to add colours everytime players successfully repeat the sequence back.
7. If the sequence was not completed successfully, the game will play a failed sound. To restart the game, repeat step 1.
